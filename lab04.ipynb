        "ANSWER: Using the default setup and 1000 function calls, a feasible solution was not found. At the end of the optimization process for this run, the algorithm developed 1000 solutions, with an $a$ value of about 0.198, but none of the solutions resulted in a case where the lake was eutrophied less than 10% of the time (i.e. inequality constraints not satified). So, I ran the optimization again, but this time I restricted the value of $a$ between 0 and 0.09 (i.e. lowering the maximum possible amount of point source P that can enter the lake). Now, given this setup, the optimization algorithm finds 14 feasible solutions, where the approximate optimum value of point source P release (i.e. value of the objective function) is about 0.036. With this setup, there are 0 failures (i.e. inequality constraints were satisfied for all end-values).    "

        "ANSWER: I first started with the same setup as in Problem 1, using bounds from 0-0.09, but I experiemnted with a higher failure probability (30%) and a lower failure probability (5%) with 2000 function evaluations (to compenstate for narrower acceptable solution space). In both cases, I got an approximate optimum value of around 0.036 and 0 failures, which is the same result as before. Next, I went back to the default setup, but this time increased the number of Monet Carlo samples by a factor of 2 (reduced the number of function evaluations accordingly for computation time purposes) to see if a wider range of input would result in more feasible solutions and it did, but the approximate optimum value and number of failures is still very similar to before. Lastly, I experimented with changing the bounds. When I increased the upper bound to 0.1, I got 2 feasible solutions, an approximate optimum value of about 0.038, but 32 failures. When I restrict the upper bound to 0.08, I get 347 feasible solutions, an approximate optimum value of about 0.033, but 0 failures. So, there are a few insights we can take from this. First, changing the bounds changed the results most significantly compared to the other parameters I experimented with. Second, when I increased the upper bound, I got a larger approximate optimum value for P release, but there were 32 failures where the inequality constraints were not satisfied. Comparing the results from using an upper bound of 0.09 (from Problem 1), with an upper bound of 0.08, both cases result in 0 failures, but the former setup has an approximate optimum value about 0.036 whereas the latter has an approximate optimum value of about 0.033. This makes sense because when we restrict the bounds, we restrict the range of values from which the algorithm can search for a solution. So, as the upper bound decreases, we get more feasible solutions and 0 failures because we're already forcing P release to be low, which results in the approximate optimum value being lower than it could be if the bounds were relaxed while still maintaining 0 failures. Since we want to maximize P release, because it is a proxy for the town's economic activity, the solution from using an upper bound of 0.09 is preferred becuase it still results in 0 failures while having a larger optimum value."

        "ANSWER: With these methods, the solutions are highly variable depending on how you define the problem and select parameter values. For example, with respect to the difference in results obtained from changing the bounds by 0.01, we get notably different solutions that satisfy the problem constraints, but you need to apply context to understand which solutions are best suited for the problem. As per the quote we discussed in class, \"The optimal solution of a model is not an optimal solution of a problem unless the model is a perfect representation of the problem\", so it is important to formulate the model to fit the problem, and not just to get a solution. Also, increasing the number of evaluations did lead to more feasible solutions, but you have to take into account the computing time when increasing the complexity of the model because you may get a solution, but you have to consider if it's worth the cost. Compared to LPs, simulation-optimization approaches provide more flexibility in the kinds of problems you can solve for becuase you don't have to satisfy the strict linearity requirements that come with using LPs. For problems that are non-linear and more complex, the simulation-optimization approaches would be more suited. However, LPs are more straightforward to use and understand as they are more explicit, whereas the computation and assumptions behind simulation-optimization approaches are not as transparent. Also, LPs provide a more definitive analytic soltuion that is scalable, whereas there is more ambiguity with the simulation-optimization methods because you can't always guarantee a global maximum/minimum.
